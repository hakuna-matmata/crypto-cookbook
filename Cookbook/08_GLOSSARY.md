## A

**Address**
A unique identifier for sending/receiving crypto. Like an email address but for blockchain. Each network has different address formats.

**Airdrop**
Free tokens distributed to wallet addresses, often as marketing or rewards for early users.

**AMM (Automated Market Maker)**
A smart contract that enables trading by holding reserves of tokens. Users trade against the pool rather than other users. Examples: Uniswap, Orca.

**APY (Annual Percentage Yield)**
The yearly return on an investment, including compound interest. A 10% APY means $100 becomes $110 after one year.

**Arbitrage**
Profiting from price differences between markets. Buy low on one exchange, sell high on another.

**Attribute (NFT)**
A trait or characteristic of an NFT (e.g., "Blue Background", "Diamond Eyes"). Attributes determine rarity.

---

## B

**Bid-Ask Spread**
The difference between the highest buy price (bid) and lowest sell price (ask). Tighter spreads = more liquid market.

**Block**
A bundle of transactions added to the blockchain together. Each block links to the previous one, forming a chain.

**Block Time**
How long between blocks. Solana: ~400ms. Ethereum: ~12 seconds. Bitcoin: ~10 minutes.

**Blockchain**
A distributed database where transactions are grouped into blocks and linked together cryptographically. Cannot be altered after recording.

**Brier Score**
A measure of prediction accuracy. Lower is better. 0 = perfect prediction. Used to evaluate prediction markets.

**Bridge**
A protocol that moves tokens between different blockchains. Example: Moving USDC from Ethereum to Solana.

---

## C

**CEX (Centralized Exchange)**
A company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange. Examples: Coinbase, Binance, Kraken. They hold your keys.

**cNFT (Compressed NFT)**
NFTs stored using merkle tree compression. Much cheaper to mint but requires off-chain indexing.

**Collateral**
Assets deposited as security for a loan or leveraged position. If you can't repay, collateral is seized.

**Concentrated Liquidity**
Providing liquidity only within a specific price range. Higher capital efficiency but requires active management.

**Confirmation**
A block added after your transaction's block. More confirmations = higher certainty transaction is final.

**Consensus**
How blockchain nodes agree on the state of the ledger. Methods include Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, Proof of History.

**Cross-Chain**
Operations or protocols that work across multiple blockchains.

**Custodial**
When a third party holds your private keys. Exchanges are custodial. "Not your keys, not your coins."

---

## D

**DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)**
An organization governed by smart contracts and token holder votes rather than traditional management.

The system for making decisions about a protocol. Usually involves token-weighted voting.

**Governance Token**
A token that grants voting rights on protocol decisions. Examples: JUP, UNI.

---

## H

**Haircut**
Discount applied to collateral value. A 20% haircut means $100 of SOL counts as $80 collateral.

**Hardware Wallet**
Physical device that stores private keys offline. Examples: Ledger, Trezor. Most secure storage method.

**Hash**
A fixed-length string generated from input data. Same input always produces same hash. Used to verify data integrity.

**Hot Wallet**
A wallet connected to the internet. Convenient but less secure than cold storage.

---

## I

---

## L

**Leverage**

**Limit Order**
An order to buy/sell only at a specific price or better. May not execute if price never reaches limit.

**Liquidation**
